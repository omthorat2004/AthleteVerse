Problem Statement:
 Revolutionizing Athlete Management in the Indian Sporting Industry
The Indian sporting industry has seen significant growth in recent years, with increasing participation and interest in various sports. However, the management of athletes remains fragmented and inefficient, lacking a centralized, technology-driven solution. Athletes, coaches, and sports organizations often struggle with challenges such as performance tracking, injury management, career planning, and financial management. The absence of a comprehensive athlete management system hinders the development of athletes, limits their potential, and creates barriers to achieving excellence in sports. There is an urgent need for a unified platform that addresses these challenges and supports the holistic development of athletes in India.
Objective:
Participants are tasked with creating an innovative, scalable, and user-friendly Athlete Management Solution tailored to the needs of the Indian sporting industry. The solution should streamline athlete management processes, enhance performance tracking, and provide tools for career development, injury prevention, and financial planning.
